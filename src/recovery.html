                    <p>
                        Power is generated from the core and lower back during cycling, these areas can become fatigued
                        and tight. This stretch releases tension along the entire spine and opens the hips while
                        stretching the calf and hamstring muscles.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>How</u></p>
                    <p>
                        
                        Begin on your hands and knees. Raise your hips up by straightening legs, keeping your hands on
                        the ground and slightly in front of your shoulders. Contract the quadriceps, and push your hips
                        back. Concentrate on pushing your heels toward the ground and keeping your spine as straight as
                        possible.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Reps</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Hold for 20–30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>2. SEATED GLUTE/PIRIFORMIS STRETCH</h3>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        The glutes are your workhorses during cycling. You rely on your glutes to generate power during hard efforts like hill repeats. If these muscles become fatigued or tight, it could lead to lower back pain. This stretch will target the glutes and piriformis muscles, which attach to the backside of your pelvis.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>How</u></p>
                    <p>
                        
                        Sit in a chair and cross one leg, with your ankle resting on the opposite knee. Keeping your back as straight as possible, bend forward at the hips so your shoulders fall toward the shin of the crossed leg
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Reps</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Hold for 20–30 seconds, and repeat 3 times.
                    </p>

                <h3>3. UPPER TRAP STRETCH</h3>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Because of the bent-over position common in rhythm cycling, the upper trapezius can become fatigued from the constant contraction needed to hold up the head. This stretch will help to loosen the muscles, which run from the base of the skull along the back of the neck to the upper shoulders.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>How</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Sit in a chair with your head in a neutral position, and place your left hand behind your left hip. Place your right hand on the left side of your head, and apply gentle downward pressure, bringing your right ear toward your right shoulder. If you want to isolate the stretch higher in the neck, slightly rotate your chin toward your right shoulder.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Reps</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Hold for 10–15 seconds, and repeat 3–4 times on each side.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>4. LUNGE AND REACH</h3>

                    <p>
                        Another core muscle, the iliopsoas, can become tight from aggressive riding styles and the upstroke during the pedaling motion. This stretch will help to relieve tension on the front side of your hips.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>How</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Lunge your left leg, and put your right knee on the ground. Keep your back straight, and lift your right arm straight up in the air, reaching for the ceiling. Twist your torso away from the knee you’re kneeling on. Repeat with the opposite leg and arm.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Reps</u></p>
                    <p>
                        Hold for 20–30 seconds, and repeat 3–4 times with each leg.
                    </p>
